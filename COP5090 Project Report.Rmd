# **Abstract**

In this project, we apply various Machine Learning (ML) models to standard problems in the field of computational statistics and optimization. A Random Forest (RF) classifer was used on a large dataset of handwritten numbers in order to train a model to recognize digits rendered on a digital draw-pad. We again used RF to in order to make predictions of insurance costs, given relevant user data like age, sex, BMI, region, etc.
